# GlobalSolution-Programming-Java
👨‍💻✍️ - The Global Solution is an evaluative work in a group of 3 participants on a recurring theme, the theme of this semester was "Hunger". On this subject, I developed a Java work on challenges from a list of exercises proposed by the teacher (I did the Java part alone).
